## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) to convey trust and stability, aligning with the institutional nature of a school management system.
- Background color: Light Indigo (#E8EAF6), providing a soft, neutral backdrop that ensures readability and reduces eye strain.
- Accent color: Violet (#7E57C2) used sparingly for interactive elements and important notifications to draw attention without overwhelming the user.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, providing a modern and neutral feel suitable for both headings and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use simple, flat icons from a consistent set (e.g., Material Design Icons) to represent data categories, actions, and navigation items. Ensure icons are intuitive and accessible.
- Design a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Use a grid system for consistency.
- Incorporate subtle animations (e.g., transitions, loading states) to enhance user experience. Avoid distracting or unnecessary animations.
